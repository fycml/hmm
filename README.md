An implementation of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with the following features:

* Unsupervised training using Baum-Welch Algorithm.
* Large scale training by using online learning techniques (mini-batch approach).
* Faster training speed by multi-threading.
* Viterbi Algorithm for decoding, supports multi-threading.
* Platform independent: written entirely in Java.
* Simple and stand-alone implementation (easy to modify).
* Supports unicode.
* Optionally uses development data to avoid overfitting (by checking perplexity).
